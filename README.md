# Weatheruu

Ever gotten depressed when you open up a weather app, and every single day, it shows you that it's going to be bad weather? Well, I live in Sweden, and that's what I experience daily!

Weatheruu was created to make weather application users happier by presenting weather information in a "happy" way. Sunny outside? Yay! A dancing sun appears! Oh no, it's raining? Don't worry too much about it, here's a cute little cloud for you!

The application is still under development. It is being developed using React Native.
